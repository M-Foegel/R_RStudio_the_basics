# R & RStudio: the basics

This is the presentation about the basics of R and RStudio, done for the mordev of October 14th, 2024 in the LLF lab. The main presentation is contained in the HTML file, and in PDF format. 
You can also render the presentation yourself by downloading all the files and render the .qmd file inside the R Project.

In this mordev we will learn about the basics of R and RStudio. We will talk about the operators, basic objects and more complicated data structures available in R as well as how to create a function. We will do all of this while navigating the different document types of the RStudio IDE. We will talk about good practices when working with R in a project and conclude by mentionning some useful shortcuts and packages.
Requirement: an up to date version of R and RStudio (you can download both at: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). You will also need to download packages necessary to open RMarkdown (from RStudio go to New File and select R Markdown and you should have a dialog box open asking you to install the necessary packages).
